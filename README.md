<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><i>This is my first large scale project using React.js and Redux.js store. The project's Components are styled with SCSS. The backend is supported by Firebase which manages user authentication (Google SSO feature included). The site also connects to the Stripe API services to manage web transactions. This was by far my most challenging app to build as a web developer. Check it out!</i></p>
